# Scalable System Architecture - EventIQ
EventIQ is a developer-first platform for tracking user behavior, product flows, and system events across large-scale web applications. It provides a lightweight SDK and event gateway backend that captures, processes, and visualizes user interaction data in real time. The goal is to help product teams and engineers understand how users navigate flows, where they drop off, and how features performâ€”with minimal instrumentation.
